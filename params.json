One misstep and you could get lost in hours/days/weeks of setup and configuration before ever getting something to run. Let's skip all that and make something anyone can run right now out-of-the-box.\r\n\r\n# The goal\r\n\r\nThe goal of tinyc.games is to have something for those interested in C game programming (the GOOD way to make games!) where:\r\n\r\n* You can click a thing to run real code in less than a minute after downloading it.\r\n* You can look at the code and understand it sometime soon (~200 lines of simple code for a simple game).\r\n* You can make changes to a game's code see your changes in the running game right quick.\r\n* NO additional configuration, Googling for downloads, or installing required.\r\n\r\n# How close are we to the goal?\r\n\r\n* On Windows everything you need is included in tinyc.games.\r\n* On Mac you'll need to install clang (it's easy!).\r\n* On most Linuxes you'll need to install tcc & SDL2, available from your system's package manager.\r\n\r\nSee the tiny README for specific information.\r\n\r\nFurther testing on more machines always helps!",
