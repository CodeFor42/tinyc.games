An interested user could get lost in hours/days/weeks of setup and configuration before ever getting something to run. It's very discouraging.\r\n\r\nVery sad!\r\n\r\nLet's fix it!\r\n\r\n# The goal\r\n\r\nThe goal of tinyc.games is to have something if you're interested in C game programming (the only RIGHT way to do it... right?!), such that:\r\n\r\n* You can click a thing to run real code in less than a minute after downloading it.\r\n* You can look at the code and understand it sometime soon (~200 lines of simple code).\r\n* You can makes changes to a game and run it with your changes.\r\n* NO additional configuration, downloading or installing required.\r\n\r\n# How close are we to the goal?\r\n\r\nPretty close? We've included everything you need on Windows. Linux requires you to install a couple standard things from your package manager. And on Mac... well... anyone know how to get TCC to link with SDL on Mac?\r\n\r\nFurther testing on more machines always helps!",
