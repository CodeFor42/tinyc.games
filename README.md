# tinyc.games
Tiny C games you can compile and run RIGHT NOW.

Tools and libraries are available for making cross-platform C games very easily, but simple examples were hard to find.

This project is an example of how you can get started making a game in C that will work on Windows, Mac and Linux with mimimal installation and configuration.

For Windows and Linux, we use the Tiny C Compliler (tcc) and for Mac we use clang.

2. Open a game folder and run run-windows.bat

## Mac
1. Install clang by typing "clang" in Terminal and clicking the Install button.
2. Open a game folder and run run-mac.sh

## Linux
1. Install tcc and the SDL2 dev libraries. Eg. for Debian/Ubuntu:

2. Open a game folder and run run-linux.sh!
